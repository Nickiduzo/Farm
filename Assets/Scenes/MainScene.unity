        All terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as defined
        in our Terms, unless specifically indicated herein.\r\n\r\nWe use the broad
        interpretation of a term \u201CPersonal Information,\u201D which includes
        combined definitions pf personal information from CCPA, COPPA, and GDPR.
        We treat any information relating to an identified or identifiable data subject
        as personal to the broadest extent. It includes but not limited to the information
        that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with,
        or may reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer
        or household. We also treat pseudonymous data and depersonalized identifiers
        as Personal Information if they allow in combination to establish a link
        between such information and a patricidal consumer, or household, or if they
        can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites or
        online services. The complete list of the Personal Information that the Company
        processes is included in Schedule A below. Please note that the Schedule
        A is not applicable to children\u2019s Personal Information.\r\n\r\n    This
        Privacy Policy applies to the Companies\u2019 policies on collection, use
        and disclosure of personal and non-personal information by the Company and

        you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use any of our Services.\r\n

        LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n    This Privacy Policy is drafted with adherence to the
        applicable privacy protection laws, including following legislation:\r\n\r\n   
        California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201CCCPA\u201D):\r\n\r\nhttp://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=1.81.5.&part=4.&chapter=&article=\r\n\r\n

        Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
        27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing
        of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
        95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation or \u201CGDPR\u201D)\r\n\r\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj\r\n\r\n   
        ONLINE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN\r\n\r\n    The Company adheres to the principles
        of the COPPA, a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children,
        in our Services that are directed to children. If you would like to learn
        more about COPPA, you can refer to the \u201CChildren\u2019s Privacy\u201D
        section of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s website.\r\n    The Company

        a different age limit, which cannot be lower than 13 (thirteen). Please help
        us in protecting children\u2019s privacy by instructing them to never provide
        any Personal Information (full name, email address, home address, phone number,
        etc.) without your permission.\r\n    Currently, THE COMPANY DOES NOT KNOWINGLY
        COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN OR WITHIN THE CHILD-ORIENTED
        PORTIONS OF OUR SERVICES except as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy.
        If we were to collect and store Personal Information from children, we would
        obtain a prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian before such
        collection, unless the collection of information falls within a COPPA-permitted
        exception.\r\n    In our Services directed to children users, we collect
        information which includes persistent identifiers such as a device identifier
        (\u201Cdevice ID\u201D) or an Internet Protocol address (\u201CIP address\u201D).
        This information is collected solely for the purpose of providing functionality
        and support for our internal operations and optimizing our users\u2019 game
        experience. We never collect precise geo-location data from children and
        do not allow practices and/or mechanisms that mislead them into sharing such
        information.\r\n    The Company does not permit behaviorally-targeted advertising
        to children in the Services where we do not have the substantial confirmation
        that the user is over the age of 13 (thirteen).\r\n    If we decide to change
        our policy regarding collection of Personal Information of children, we will
        receive your prior verifiable consent in all cases before such the collection.\r\n   
        In case we detect the unintended collection of Personal Information from
        children, including cases when children voluntarily share their information,
        we may use this information only to respond directly to a child\u2019s specific
        one-time request. COPPA permits not to make a direct notification is this
        case. We will not use the information to contact the child again and we will
        delete it after we respond to the request. In all other cases we will:\r\n\r\n   
        notify parents we collected their online contact information;\r\n    notify
        parents we collected their child\u2019s online contact information;\r\n   
        notify parents the online contact information will not be used for any other
        purpose other than the one as determined in notification and will not be
        disclosed or combined with other information;\r\n    notify parents that
        if they do not opt out, we may use the child\u2019s online contact information
        for that purpose; and\r\n    hyperlink to this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n   
        If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected your child\u2019s
        Personal Information without your prior consent, you may contact the Company\u2019s
        Privacy Officer by contacts stipulated in Section 10..\r\n\r\n    INFORMATION
        COLLECTED\r\n\r\n    THE COMPANY\u2019S POLICY IS NOT TO COLLECT PERSONAL
        INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 (THIRTEEN) YEARS OLD FOR THE
        UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES, OR 16 (SIXTEEN) FOR THE EURIPEAN UNION,
        UNLESS OTHERWISE ESTABLISHED BY NATIONAL LAW.\r\n    There are two types
        of information that may be collected by the Company:\r\n\r\n    the first
        is called Personal Information which is information that can be used to identify
        a specific individual. As stated in the previous section, the Company does
        not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children outside of the
        information and required for the support of internal operations. In this
        case we use the \u201Cemail plus\u201D method, when we send an email to the
        parent or legal guardian and have them respond with their consent. Then we
        send a confirmation to the parent via email, letter, or phone call. In this
        case we also let the parent know they can revoke their consent anytime. The
        Company may collect Personal Information that parents, legal guardians or
        persons 13 (thirteen) years old or over voluntarily provide via the Services.\r\n   
        the second type of information is non-personal information which does not
        directly identify an individual. The Company may collect non-personal information
        about your use of the Services to help us improve our Services or for other
        purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n    We may combine the
        non-personal information and Personal Information of people above 13 (thirteen)
        years old for the United States and other countries, or 16 (sixteen) for
        the European Union, unless otherwise established by national law that we
        receive through our Services. Information collected will vary depending upon
        the activity and may include your name, email address, phone number, mobile
        number, device type, operating system, home address, birth date, statistical
        and usage data (as further explained below), proof of identify (such as the
        Social Security, Social Identification Number or Social Insurance Number)
        of contest prize winners and, to the extent required to process any payment,
        your credit card information. In addition, we may collect demographic information
        such as gender, zip code or postal code and other data that you may provide
        in surveys or online profiles, for instance. We may combine demographic information
        with Personal Information.\r\n    For EU only: per requirements under GDPR,
        we log your consent state for compliance purposes. This information is stored
        on servers hosted in the EU and is used solely for GDPR compliance. The device
        identifier is stored along with the consent status. If you consent to personalized
        advertising, your device advertising identifier also is stored in case we
        need to be able to access it to assist you with data portability or erasure
        requests. Your device advertising identifier is not stored in our consent
        logging database if you do not consent to personalized advertising.\r\n   
        Please note that this data is collected automatically by third parties (controllers
        or processors under GDPR) due to your use of our products if you accept this
        Privacy Policy:\r\n\r\n    data about your game progress;\r\n    your IP
        address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising
        ID, MAC address, IMEI);\r\n    data about your device, such as device name
        and operating system, browser type and language;\r\n    general location
        data;\r\n    precise geo-location data (GPS, only for users above 13 (thirteen)
        years old for the United States and other countries, or 16 (sixteen) for
        the European Union, unless otherwise established by national law and with
        their direct consent);\r\n    data about your use of our application, such
        as gameplay data and interactions with other players (if applicable and only
        for users above 13 (thirteen) years old for the United States and other countries,
        or 16 (sixteen) for the European Union, unless otherwise established by national
        law).\r\n\r\n    When required by law, the Company reserves the right to
        disclose your Personal Information to third parties or regulatory, law enforcement
        or other government authorities.\r\n    We may also disclose your information
        to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect
        our rights or property. If at any time you choose to purchase a product or
        service offered by another company, for example by clicking on an advertisement
        on a website owned or controlled by the Company, any Personal Information
        you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy
        Policy.\r\n    Our software products include features from our partners,
        such as social media interaction tools and in-game advertising. A list of
        these partners is available below. These partners may access your data and
        operate under their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the
        privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and we have no control
        over the use or protection of information provided by you to, or collected
        by, those websites. Whenever you click the link to a co-branded website or
        to a linked website, you may be asked to provide registration or other information.
        Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party
        and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy published by
        that third party. We encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn

        PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED\r\n\r\n    We do not
        collect your children\u2019s Personal Information. Therefore, this section
        foes not apply to children\u2019s Personal Information. If such collection
        occurs in future, we will notify you and obtain your prior verifiable consent.
        We will endeavor to prevent collection of such information and timely notify
        you in case of accidental collection.\r\n    The Company may use the Personal
        Information you provide us for the purposes of: \r\n\r\n    administering
        contests and awarding prizes which are only directed to parents and adult
        users;\r\n    warranty registration and/or providing customer support or
        responding to technical service requests;\r\n    providing online services
        for parents and users over 13 (thirteen) years old for the United States
        and other countries, or 16 (sixteen) for the European Union, unless otherwise
        established by national law;\r\n    registration for games or special game-specific
        event participation for parents and users over 13 (thirteen) years old for
        the United States and other countries, or 16 (sixteen) for the European Union,
        unless otherwise established by national law;\r\n    registration for membership
        and participation on our site;\r\n    processing your order(s) of products
        or subscriptions from us online;\r\n    enabling your use of our software
        or online services and access to certain areas of our site, features or programs;\r\n   
        beta-testing;\r\n    newsletter sign-up; or\r\n    improving our products
        and services.\r\n\r\n    You are not required to provide Personal Information
        to us to obtain access to any of our Services; however, the collection, use
        and disclosure of your Personal Information may be required for registration
        to access certain areas or features of our Services and, if you do not provide
        the required information, you will not have access to these areas or features.\r\n   
        Statistical and Usage Data: when you use our Services on your device, we
        may retrieve information about your hardware system and how your game is
        played, including your IP address or device ID. We may also collect information
        about your computer, hardware, software, platform, media, connection, information
        about online activity such as feature usage, game play statistics and scores,
        user rankings, click paths, and in-app purchases. We use this information
        to enable you to play our game over the Internet. We also use this information
        to better understand preferences of our customers, so that we can improve
        our products and services.\r\n    Other Uses: we may also use your information
        for other legitimate business purposes. We will only collect information
        to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
        collected and our legitimate business objectives or as permitted or required
        by law.\r\n    Internet Protocol Address: we collect an IP address from every
        visitor to our Services. An IP address is a number that is automatically
        assigned to your computer or device when you use the Internet. We use IP
        addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer our Services,
        analyze trends, track users' movement on our Services, gather broad demographic
        information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Services, and
        deliver customized, personalized content. We do not link IP addresses with
        any personally identifiable information.\r\n    In-Game Advertising: our
        Services may incorporate dynamic advertisement serving technology offered
        by our ad provider (Adwords), which enables advertising to be temporarily
        uploaded into the game and replaced while you play. The data collected for
        this purpose may include IP address or players\u2019 user name, downloaded
        or purchased Services, in game location, length of time an advertisement
        was visible, size of the advertisements, and angle of view. The Services
        you are using may be assigned an ID number, which is stored on your device,
        and used by our Ad Provider to calculate the number of unique and repeat
        views of dynamic in-game advertising. THE ID NUMBER IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH
        ANY PERSONAL DATA AND FOR CHILDREN-DIRECTED SERVICES IS NOT USED FOR BEHAVIORAL
        ADVERTISING PURPOSES. NONE OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED FOR ADVERTISING
        PURPOSES IS USED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFY YOU OR YOUR CHILD. WE DO NOT EMPLOY
        BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISEMENT FOR CHILDREN. The servers used by the ad provider
        may be located outside your country of residence. This ad serving technology
        is integrated into the Services; if you do not want to use this technology,
        do not use our mobile applications while connected to the Internet.\r\n   
        In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Company\u2019s
        advertising partners in the European Economic Area all function as independent
        data controllers. Prior to showing a personalized advertisement, you will
        be asked whether you consent to sharing your information with the advertising
        company. If you are a resident of an European Union member state and indicate
        that your child is below the age of 16 (sixteen) or a lower age established
        in your member state but not lower than 13 (thirteen) years old, your child
        will be served non-personalized ads and the advertising companies will not
        collect Personal Information from your child.\r\n\r\n    HOW WE SHARE OR
        DISCLOSE INFORMATION\r\n\r\n    The Company may share your information with
        third parties for the limited purposes described below. This Section does
        not concern any child\u2019s Personal Information, to which provision of
        Section 3. is applicable.\r\n    Third Parties: you may register for other
        services from our Services which are offered by third parties. If you opt
        in to any of these third-party services, we may collect additional information
        requested by this third party and pass this information, together with all
        other registration information (including Personal Information), to that
        third party. Use of your information by a third party will be governed by
        that third party\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy. Participation
        in these other related services is optional and is not required to play or
        participate in any of our Services.\r\n    Partners: the Company may also
        share non-personal information with our brand partners, which may include
        without limitation game session information, retention, purchases, gameplay
        events and user behavior. The Company does not share any Personal Information
        with these partners.\r\n    Marketing: The Personal Information you provide
        will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special
        offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. From
        time to time, we may also inform you on other companies and organizations
        that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
        We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products
        or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those
        offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. You may opt out of this
        service by contacting us as set out in the opt-out provision below.\r\n   
        Legal Rights and Obligations: Finally, we may use and/or disclose your Personal
        Information to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply
        with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when
        we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential
        or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users
        or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage. When necessary,
        we may also disclose Personal Information to law enforcement, or to the appropriate
        civil authorities.\r\n    The Company does not knowingly share or disclose
        personal information other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n   
        YOUR RIGHTS\r\n\r\n    You are not required by law to provide us with certain
        Personal Information. You can always refuse to provide certain Personal Information;
        however, you acknowledge that such refusal may prevent you from engaging
        in certain activities within Services or from engaging with Services completely.\r\n   
        Under the GDPR, you have various rights in relation to your Personal Information.
        All of these rights can be exercised by contacting us via email designated
        in Section 10.. In certain circumstances, you have the following rights in
        relation to your Personal Information:\r\n\r\n    Right of access\r\n\r\nYou
        have the right to obtain from us information as to whether your Personal
        Information is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to such
        personal information. You may access and amend your Personal Information,
        request the details about purposes of processing of your Personal Information
        and prevent undesirable marketing by opting-out. If you wish to opt out of
        marketing, use \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 option available at our emails.\r\n\r\n   
        Right to withdraw consent\r\n\r\nWhen we rely on your consent for the processing
        of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent
        at any time. However, the withdrawal of your consent will not affect the
        lawfulness of the Company\u2019s processing based on consent before your
        withdrawal.\r\n\r\n    Right to rectification\r\n\r\nWe will use reasonable
        endeavors to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate. In order
        to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the Personal
        Information that you have provided to us by sending us a request to rectify
        your Personal Information where you believe the Personal Information that
        we have is inaccurate or incomplete.\r\n\r\n    Right to restriction of processing\r\n\r\nYou
        have the right to ask us to stop processing your Personal Information at
        any time.\r\n\r\n    Right to erasure\r\n\r\nAsking us to delete all of your
        Personal Information will result in the Company deleting your Personal Information
        without undue delay (unless there is a legitimate and legal reason why we
        are unable to delete certain of your personal information, in which case
        we will inform you of this). Asking us to stop processing your Personal Information
        or deleting your Personal Information on may mean that you will no longer
        be able to use our site.\r\n\r\n    Right to information portability\r\n\r\nYou
        have the right to request that the Company provides you with a copy of all
        of your Personal Information and to transmit your Personal Information to
        another data controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
        format, where it is technically feasible for us to do so and the processing
        is based on consent or contractual performance.\r\n\r\n    Right to complain\r\n\r\nAlthough
        we encourage our customers to engage with us in the event, they have any
        concerns or complaints, you have the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory
        authority.\r\n\r\n    Right to object automated processing\r\n\r\nYou have
        the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing
        of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or
        similarly significant effects on you. There may be exceptions or limitations
        to this right as defined under relevant data protection laws. We will not
        ordinarily charge you in respect of any requests we receive to exercise any
        of your rights detailed above, however, if you make excessive, repetitive
        or manifestly unfounded requests, we may charge you an administration fee
        in order to process such requests or refuse to act on such requests. When
        you request us to rectify or erase your Personal Information or restrict
        any processing of such information, we may notify third parties to whom such
        Personal Information has been disclosed of such request. However, such a
        third party may have the right to retain and continue to process such Personal
        Information in its own right, for example, to enable it to comply with its
        own legal obligations.\r\n\r\n    Right to make a request\r\n\r\nYou may
        also send a request to receive the information which is being processed,
        amended, deleted or locked and information about any parties to which we
        transmit your personal information.\r\n\r\n    In some cases, we may charge
        a fee (based on our reasonable costs) if the requests are excessive considering
        the nature of the request itself or nature and functionality of our services.\r\n   
        The Company does not discriminate against a consumer who exercises any of
        the consumer's rights under the CCPA. However, the Company may charge different
        prices or provide a different quality of goods or services if the difference
        is reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer's
        data and may offer financial incentives to a consumer for the collection,
        sale, or deletion of personal information on a prior opt-in consent basis.\r\n\r\n

        entitled to decide if you wish to share any information with us. We do not
        enable opt-in blockers that prevent you from using the Services without giving
        your consent. We also do not embed opt-in possibilities in child-oriented

        collection of personal information. Such consent can be obtained by us only
        from you.\r\n    Opt-Out Provision: currently, the Company does not share
        personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. In the event

        we have collected from you without undue delay. You can do so by contacting

        respect to our products and Services. If you opt to receive such communications,
        you may opt out of this consent at any time by contacting us as described
        above or by using the unsubscribe mechanism included in the email communications
        you will receive. You may also modify your user settings to edit the email

        information in accordance with this Privacy Policy to the extent deemed reasonably
        necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain
        appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, accuracy and privacy
        of the information you have provided. In addition, we will take reasonable
        steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information
        will provide sufficient protection of that information.\r\n    Under the
        GDPR you have a right to request a copy of the personal data the Company
        and our third-party partners have collected from you.\r\n    Business Transactions:

        link, or other third-party service, you will leave the Company site you are
        visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities
        of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal
        information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will
        adhere to the same privacy and security practices as the Company. We encourage
        you to review the privacy policies of these third-party sites from whom you

        The Services are owned and operated by the Company.\r\n\r\n        Unless
        otherwise indicated, all content, information, and other materials on the

        property and proprietary rights and laws.\r\n\r\n        All Materials contained
        on the Services are the property of the Company, its Affiliates or and/or
        third-party licensors. Unless otherwise expressly stated in writing by the
        Company, by agreeing to these Terms you are granted a limited, non-sublicensable
        license (i.e. a personal and limited right) to access and use the Services
        for your personal use only.\r\n\r\n        The Company reserves all rights
        not expressly granted in these Terms. This license is subject to these Terms

        resale or commercial use of the Services or the Materials;\r\n\r\n           
        distribution, public performance or public display of any Materials;\r\n\r\n           
        modifying or otherwise making any derivative uses of the Services or the

        robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods;\r\n\r\n

        or any information contained in them, except as expressly permitted on the
        Twitch Services; or\r\n\r\n            any use of the Services or the Materials
        except for their intended purposes. Any use of the Twitch Services or the
        Materials except as specifically authorized in these Terms of Service, without
        the prior written permission of the Company, is strictly prohibited and may
        violate intellectual property rights or other laws.\r\n\r\n        Unless
        explicitly stated in these Terms, nothing in them shall be interpreted as
        conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel,
        implication or other legal principles.\r\n\r\n        The Company can terminate
        this license at any time, without notice, including where we reasonably consider
        that:\r\n\r\n            your use of the Services violates these Terms or
        applicable law;\r\n\r\n            you fraudulently use or misuse the Twitch

        to you for any reason.\r\n\r\n        The Company owns, has licensed, or
        otherwise has rights to use all of the content that appears in the Service.
        These Terms do not grant you or any other party any right, title or interest
        in the Service or any content in the Service.\r\n\r\n        So long as you
        abide by these Terms the Company grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        revocable limited license subject to the limitations in these Terms, to access
        and use the Service using mobile device solely for your own non-commercial
        entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Service for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n       
        If you violate these Terms, or any of our other terms that apply to you,
        we may take action against you. In addition, you may be breaking the law,
        including violations of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights.
        Any attempt by you to disrupt or interfere with the Services including without
        limitation undermining or manipulating the legitimate operation of any the
        Company\u2019s Services is a violation of the Terms and may be a violation
        of criminal and/or civil laws.\r\n\r\n        Notwithstanding other provisions
        of these Terms, or any other terms that may apply to features you may choose
        to use, you do not own in-game currency or items, regardless of whether you
        \u201Cearned\u201D those items in a game or \u201Cpurchased\u201D them. The
        Company gives you a limited license to use Virtual items during your use
        of the Services.\r\n\r\n        You are not allowed to use Virtual Items
        outside of the scope allowed by the Service (i.e., in the \u201Creal world\u201D),
        for example by selling, gifting, or trading them. We will not recognize those
        transfers as legitimate. You are not allowed to sublicense, trade, sell or
        attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for \u201Creal\u201D money, or exchange
        Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game. Any such transfer
        or attempted transfer is prohibited and may result in suspension or restriction
        of your access to the Services along with an obligation to reimburse the
        damages to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    PAYMENT TERMS\r\n\r\n        We provide
        the Services in the form of access to games and Virtual Items. You can use
        \u201Creal world\u201D money to obtain subscription to games or a limited
        license to use Virtual Items.\r\n\r\n        Virtual Items and subscriptions
        to our games purchased on AppStore and Google Play Market will be subject
        to those platforms\u2019 payment terms and conditions. The Company does not
        control how you can pay on those platforms. Please review those platforms\u2019
        terms of use for additional information.\r\n\r\n        For subscription
        to a game or Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to obtain
        a subscription or a limited license for the relevant Services or Virtual
        Items which will be accepted by us when we accept your payment.\r\n\r\n       
        For orders to obtain a subscription or a limited license to use Virtual Items,
        by clicking the button on the purchase window or page you:\r\n\r\n           
        agree that we may start to supply your purchased subscription/Virtual Items
        immediately after you have clicked that button;\r\n\r\n            if you
        reside in the European Union, you acknowledge that you will therefore no
        longer have the right to cancel under the EU\u2019s Consumer Rights Directive
        (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we
        start to supply the subscription/Virtual Item.\r\n\r\n        All sales are
        final. You acknowledge that the Company is not required to provide a refund
        for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation
        for unused Virtual Items or subscription to a game unless otherwise is not
        determined by the rules of platforms of applicable law.\r\n\r\n        You
        agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you. The Company may
        revise the pricing for subscriptions to its games or Virtual Items it licenses
        to you through the Service at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRIVACY\r\n\r\n       
        The Company\u2019s Privacy Policy is drafted in mind with respective regulations
        such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201CCCPA\u201D), Children's
        Online Privacy Protection Rule (\"COPPA\"), General Data Protection Regulation
        (\u201CGDPR\u201D) and other applicable laws and regulations. The Privacy
        Policy informs you on how we collect and use information about you and your
        computer or mobile device, and how you can use the Services to share such
        information with others and about our information collection, disclosure,
        and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children.\r\n\r\n       
        You understand that through your use of our Services you acknowledge the
        collection, use and sharing of this information as described in the Company\u2019s
        Privacy Policy. If you don\u2019t agree with the Privacy Policy, then you
        must stop using our Services.\r\n\r\n        We encourage you to read the
        Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   
        THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING\r\n\r\n        Our Service and our games may feature
        advertisements from Us or other companies. Our Privacy Policy explains what
        information we share with advertisers.\r\n\r\n        Sometimes we provide
        links in our games or on the Services to other companies\u2019 websites or
        to companies who invite you to participate in a promotional offer and offer
        you some feature of the Service or upgrade (such as in-game currency) in
        exchange. Any charges or obligations you take on in dealing with these other
        companies are your responsibility.\r\n\r\n        We make no representation
        or promises about any content, goods or services these other companies provide,
        even if linked to or from our Service or games. Also, just because we allow
        a link to be included in our games or Service does not mean we endorse that
        linked site. We are not liable for any claim relating to any content, goods
        and/or services of third parties.\r\n\r\n        Please also note that the
        linked sites are not under our control and may collect data or ask you to
        provide them with your personal or other information, or they may automatically
        collect information from you. When you use other companies\u2019 services
        like these, the other company\u2019s service may (or may not) ask you for
        permission to access your information and content. We are not responsible
        for these other companies\u2019 content, business practices or privacy policies,
        or for how they collect, use or share the information they get from you.
        Your relationship with that other company will control how it can use, store,
        and share your information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WARRANTY DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\n       
        THE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE ON AN \u201CAS IS\u201D AND \u201CAS AVAILABLE\u201D
        BASIS. NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY AFFILIATE PROMISES OR WARRANTS THAT THE
        SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR VIRUS-FREE.\r\n\r\n       
        USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE APPLICABLE
        LAW, THE COMPANY AND AFFILIATE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERMS
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE COMPANY AND
        ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS
        OR OTHER TERMS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n        If your state or country
        does not allow these disclaimers, they do not apply to you. If your state
        or country requires a certain period for which a warranty applies, it will
        be either the shorter of 30 (thirty) days from your first use of the Service
        or the shortest period required by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIMITATIONS; WAIVERS
        OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\n        You acknowledge that the Company and the Affiliates
        are not liable:\r\n\r\n            for any indirect, incidental, special,
        exemplary or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill
        or data, in any way whatsoever arising out of the use of, or inability to
        use, the Services; or\r\n\r\n            for the conduct of third parties,
        including other users of the Services and operators of external sites.\r\n\r\n       
        The risk of using the Services and external sites rests entirely upon you
        as does the risk of injury from the service and external sites.\r\n\r\n       
        To the fullest extent allowed by any law that applies, the disclaimers of
        liability in these Terms apply to all damages or injury caused by the Services,
        or related to use of, or inability to use, the service, under any cause of
        action in any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach
        of warranty, breach of contract or tort (including negligence).\r\n\r\n       
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW:\r\n\r\n            IN
        NO EVENT SHALL TWITCH OR THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT
        OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT
        NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN
        ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE,
        ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
        THE SERVICES, THE CONTENT OR THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
        ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE BY YOU ON ANY INFORMATION
        OBTAINED FROM US, OR THAT RESULTS FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS,
        DELETION OF FILES OR EMAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION
        OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM,
        COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO TWITCH\u2019S
        RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES; AND\r\n\r\n            IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
        AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND/OR AFFILIATES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
        WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED),
        PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
        TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE $10.00 (TEN UNITED
        STATES DOLLARS ZERO CENTS).\r\n\r\n        If some states or countries do
        not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions
        of liability described above, these limitations/exclusions may not apply
        to you if you reside in one of those states or countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   
        INDEMNITY\r\n\r\n        If you use or misuse the Service, or if you violate
        these Terms or any other applicable rules, and that results in loss or damage
        or in a claim or liability against the Company or its Affiliates, you agree
        to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates. It
        means that you agree to compensate the Company and/or Affiliates in full
        all losses, damages, claims or liabilities, including compensating the Company
        and Affiliates all legal fees or expenses.\r\n\r\n        The Company and/or
        Affiliates are allowed to take exclusive charge of the defense of any case
        on which you are required to compensate or reimburse them, and it will be
        at your expense. You also have to cooperate with the Company and Affiliates
        in these cases.\r\n\r\n        This Section 9 shall survive if you stop using
        the Services or their termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    APPLICABLE LAW\r\n\r\n       
        These Terms and our relationship will be governed by laws of British Virgin
        Islands, except for its conflicts of laws principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   
        DISPUTE RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n        The disputes arising pursuant these Terms,
        Privacy Policy, and any other documents regulating relations between you
        and the Company shall be resolved by the way of amicable negotiations and
        in good faith.\r\n\r\n        Shall the negotiations fail, all disputes shall
        be resolved to the courts of the British Virgin Islands, unless we both agree
        on some other location, and you and the Company both consent to venue and
        personal jurisdiction in British Virgin Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SEVERABILITY\r\n\r\n       
        If any part of these Terms or the Privacy Policy is not enforceable for any
        reason, the rest of these Terms and the Privacy Policy still applies and
        is binding and any unenforceable term will be substituted reflecting our
        intent as closely as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SUBMISSIONS\r\n\r\n       
        By submitting ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals (\u201CSubmissions\u201D)
        to the Company, Affiliates or their employees, you acknowledge and agree
        that the Company shall be entitled to use or disclose such Submissions for
        any purpose in any way without providing compensation or credit to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   
        ASSIGNMENT\r\n\r\n        We may give our rights, or our obligations, under
        these Terms or our Privacy Policy to any person or entity at any time with
        or without your consent. You may not give your rights or your obligations
        under these Terms, Policy or our Privacy Policy without first getting the
        Company\u2019s written consent, and any attempt to do so without our consent
        is void.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ENTIRE AGREEMENT\r\n\r\n        These Terms,
        and any other policies or rules we reference via these Terms, make up the
        entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter of these
        Terms, and (except in the case of fraud or made a fraudulent misstatement)
        supersede all prior understandings of the parties relating to the subject
        matter of these Terms, whether those prior understandings were electronic,
        oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent,
        between you and us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    LANGUAGE OF THE TERMS\r\n\r\n       
        If we provide a translated version of these Terms or Privacy Policy, or any
        other legal documents, it is for informational purposes only.\r\n\r\n       
        If discrepancies arise between the translated version and the English version,
        then the English version shall prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO WAIVER\r\n\r\n       
        If we do not enforce any our right under these Terms or the Privacy Policy,
        that shall not mean that we waive our right to do so later.\r\n\r\n       
        If we do expressly waive a provision of these Terms or our Privacy Policy
        that does not mean it is waived for all time in the future.\r\n\r\n       
        Any waiver must be in writing and signed by both you and us to be legally
        binding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTICES\r\n\r\n        You acknowledge and agree
        that we can send notifications to you by posting in the Company\u2019 relevant
        Services that you use (e.g. sites, mobile applications).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   
        CHANGES TO THESE TERMS\r\n\r\n        We reserve the right, at our discretion,
        to change, modify, add or remove portions of the Terms, Privacy Policy, anytime
        by posting the amended Terms or Privacy Policy on our site or within the
        Service (such as through in-game notices). Unless we state otherwise, changes
        are effective when posted. If you continue to use the Services after the
        changes are posted you agree to the changes. New versions of the Terms and
        the Privacy Policy and any other policies, codes or rules will be accessible
        within the Services.\r\n\r\n        If you have a dispute with the Company,
        the version of the Terms and the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the
        Company received actual notice of the dispute will apply to such dispute.
        However, if you keep using the Service after the changes are posted, you
        are agreeing that the changes apply to your continued use of the Services.\r\n\r\n       
        You can\u2019t make changes to the Terms or Privacy Policy unless both you
        and the Company sign a written amendment.\r\n\r\n        If the Terms or
        the Privacy Policy or Children\u2019s Online Privacy Policy have provisions
        that contradict other The Company terms or policies, the provisions in these
        Terms and the Privacy Policy shall prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    EQUITABLE
        REMEDIES\r\n\r\n        You agree that given the unique and irreplaceable
        nature of the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms if you
        breach these Terms and/or our Privacy Policy, or intend to breach these Terms,
        and/or Privacy Policy, money damages alone will not be enough to repair the
        harm to the Company. Therefore, the Company may seek injunctive or other
        equitable relief (e.g. get a court order to make you stop doing whatever
        you\u2019re doing that is causing harm).\r\n\r\n        The Company does
        not have to post any bond or surety or submit proof of damages.\r\n\r\n       
        You agree to limit your claims to claims for money damages, as limited by
        Section 8 (Limitations; Waivers of Liability). You also agree not to seek
        injunctive or equitable relief or otherwise seek to stop us from operating
        any aspect of the Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    FORCE MAJEURE\r\n\r\n       
        We are not liable for inability to fulfill our obligation under these Terms
        and/or Privacy Policy, for inability to provide Services, for any changes
        or problems occurring as a result of events out of our control, for example
        changes or problems caused by natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes,
        acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure
        failures, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy,
        labor or materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONTACT INFORMATION\r\n\r\n       
        You may contact the Company by the following email: farm@llill.xyz\n"
